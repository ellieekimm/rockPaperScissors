# rockpaperscissors
A program that utilizes HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript to replicate a rock paper scissors game. 

**How it works**
The user selects a move, leading the the program randomly selects its move simultaneously. When the users win / loses, the respective sound and screen flash is displayed. 

**What I Learned**
This is my first side project utilizing Javascript and it was a great way to learn the basics of the programming languages, both in terms of syntax and manipulating HTML and CSS.
